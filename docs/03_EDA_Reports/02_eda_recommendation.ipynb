    "After conducting pure colour analysis on images, we extracted exif data from images and combined them with the image colour feature data which allows us to check the effect of camera models on different rock types. In order to show results in a more intuitive and interactive way, we create a dashboard using plotly dash that a user can select a rock type of interest and visualize the distribution of each colour feature with different camera models. If a user wants to check out any peculiar values (range of values) on the feature, the system will generate the spreadsheet for him/her to examine which images have potential issues."
